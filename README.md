# AirBnB clone | The Console

  
This project initiates your AirBnB clone web app development, setting the stage for future steps such as HTML/CSS, databases, API integration, and front-end design. Objectives include implementing the BaseModel class, serialization/deserialization, creating AirBnB object classes, introducing File Storage, and conducting unit tests.

  
This console lets you create, update, and delete objects using a command interpreter. You can also save and keep your objects in a JSON file, without concern of how they are stored.
